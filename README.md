# React Native Interaction Lab

This repository is a personal lab for exploring interaction and animation in React Native. It focuses on recreating real-world UI patterns and motion effects — to practice how they actually work. Through small, focused prototypes, it’s a space for technical curiosity and hands-on learning with libraries like [Reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated), [Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia), and [Gesture Handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler).
