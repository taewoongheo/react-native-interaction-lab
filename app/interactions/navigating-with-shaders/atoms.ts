// What's that?
// It's just a way to manage the notes in the app and save them into a Global State.
// We could have used a Context for this, but I this is way faster and simpler
// The truth is that I was lazy to create a context for this, but it's also a good example of how to use Jotai
// You can use this atom in any component and it will be reactive,
// meaning that if you change the notes in one component,
// it will update in all components that are using it.

// I talked about Jotai in this article:
